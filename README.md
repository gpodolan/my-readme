# READ.ME - Gabriel Podolan
This a brief description of my habits, quirks and ways of working. It should help understand my default settings and reactions.

## Me in a nutshell
I'm a family guy, husband, father of 4 (5 if you count the dog), heavy metal fan, grill pilot, singer and guitarist. I'm also a cybersecurity, privacy and data science enthusiast, so I'm fortunate to do what I **love**.

My IT career started in 2000 when I built my first website. From there I had a few different experiences that you can check out in my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gpodolan).

These are a few principles I live by and do my best to live up to:
* Communication is key.
* Without feedback, nothing improves.
* Mistakes are a powerful teacher.
* Disagreement nurtures ideas. Commitment empowers them.
* Nothing is impossible.

In my spare time, I make music with one of my former band mates from Brazil, which you can find in my [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvHx_nxEo79Fn2sGLPsEBlA)

## Communication
This one is the foundation of everything for me. My particular style is based on a these concepts:

* The sender is responsible for the understanding of the message. If someone didn't understand what I said or wrote, _I didn't explain it right_.
* I prioritize my messages/communication like this: 
  1. Phone (immediate)
  2. SMS (within the hour)
  3. Chat (within 4 hours)
  4. Email (by the next day) 
* "To:" = FYA, "Cc:" = FYI
* Silence = approval/acceptance.
