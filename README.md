# READ.ME - Gabriel Podolan
This is a short READ.ME file describing my habits and quirks when it comes to ways of working. It is not supposed to be a manual on how to work with me, but what I will default to if there is no other agreement on something different.
It is also a way to reflect on my working style and figure out areas of improvement, so feel free to create issues with any feedback you may have.
